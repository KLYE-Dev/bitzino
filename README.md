## History

Bitzino broke ground in the online gaming universe as...

- First Bitcoin casino
- First provably fair casino

Its proprietor was known as "Libertaad" ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/libertaad)).

Its technical blog had a number of pieces on proving game fairness through cryptography.

The site shutdown in 2016 for unknown reasons.
